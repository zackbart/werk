  Local-first task, decision, and session tracking via the werk CLI.
  Use for all project planning, work decomposition, dependency management,
  and architectural decision recording. Activate when the user mentions
  starting or ending work, picking tasks, filing bugs or features, breaking
  down work into epics/tasks/subtasks, recording decisions, checking what
  to work on next, reviewing progress, or tracking multi-session features.
  Also activate for "what should I work on", "I'm done for today",
  "log what we decided", "break this down", or any project planning context.
compatibility: Requires the werk binary in PATH. Run werk init to set up.

# werk

Use the `werk` CLI for all task, decision, and session tracking. DB lives at `.werk/tasks.db`. Always pass `--agent` on all write commands.

Items use hash IDs as their primary identifier: `ep-a1b2c3` (epic), `tk-a1b2c3` (task), `st-a1b2c3` (subtask). Always use the `id` field from JSON output to reference items in subsequent commands. The `ref` field (e.g. `1.2`) is a display-only label for the web UI — do not use it as a CLI argument.

See [CLI Reference](references/CLI.md) for full command list and output format.
See [Guide](references/GUIDE.md) for issue classification, setup, dependencies, archiving, and other reference material.

## Invariants — never break these

- Always start and end sessions — this is how context transfers between agents
- Always record decisions when making non-obvious technical choices — this prevents re-litigation
- Never work on a task with open blockers
- Prefer closing over deleting — delete only duplicates and mistakes
- Close/delete children before parents (subtasks -> task -> epic)
- Always pass `--agent` on all write commands
- File discovered work immediately — don't leave it untracked

## Session lifecycle

Sessions are how work context survives between agents and across time. Without them, the next agent starts blind.

**Start every session:**

```
werk session start --with-context --agent
```

The `--with-context` flag returns the session object bundled with recent log, ready tasks, and in-progress tasks — everything needed to orient in one call.

Alternatively, without `--with-context`:

```
werk session start --agent
werk log --pretty --agent              # catch up on recent activity
werk task ready --agent
werk task list --status in_progress --agent
```

Use `werk log --verbose --pretty -n 10` if you need more context (notes, rationale, session details).

**End every session:**

```
werk session end --summary "<plain-English description of what was accomplished>" --agent
```

The summary should orient the next agent quickly in one or two sentences. Cover: what was done, what was filed or discovered, and what's left or blocked. Skip implementation details — focus on outcomes.

Good: "Implemented hash ID generation and wired audit trail to all write commands. Filed 2 tasks for edge cases found during testing."
Bad: "Updated id.go to use sha256 truncation with 6-char prefix, added audit INSERT calls to CreateTask, UpdateTask, and DeleteTask functions, also noticed..."

If `--summary` is omitted, an auto-summary is generated from audit entries during the session.

## Core workflow

1. `werk next --agent` — pick the highest-priority ready task and start it automatically
   - Or manually: `werk task ready --agent` then `werk task start <id> --agent`
2. `werk subtask list --task <id> --agent` — check for subtasks
3. Do the work. File subtasks for steps discovered along the way.
4. `werk task note <id> "<text>" --agent` — append progress notes as you go
5. **Decision checkpoint:** Did you choose between alternatives or make a non-obvious tradeoff? File a decision *now* — not later. Keep it tight: the summary is the choice ("Use X over Y"), the rationale is the *why* in 1-2 sentences. Skip decisions for obvious or forced choices.
6. `werk subtask close <id> --agent` — close each subtask as you finish it
7. `werk task close <id> --agent` — close the task (all subtasks must be done first)
8. `werk task ready --agent` — check for newly unblocked work and repeat

### Bulk operations

Start, close, and reopen accept multiple IDs:

```
werk task close tk-a1b2c3 tk-d4e5f6 tk-g7h8i9 --agent
werk subtask start st-a1b2c3 st-d4e5f6 --agent
```

## Filing new work

Read the [Issue Classification Guide](references/GUIDE.md) for detailed guidance on titles, notes, and when to file each type. Summary:

- **Epic** — a shippable feature or goal spanning multiple sessions (3-10 tasks). Noun phrase title, notes explain *why* and acceptance criteria.
- **Task** — a concrete unit of work within an epic. Imperative verb title ("Implement X", "Fix Y when Z"). Notes give operational context.
- **Subtask** — a discrete step within a task. Specific title saying exactly what will be done.
- **Decision** — a permanent record of a non-obvious choice. Summary states the choice, rationale explains *why*.

```
werk epic create "Feature Name" --high --notes "Why and acceptance criteria" --agent
werk task create "Implement X" --epic ep-a1b2c3 --notes "Approach hints" --agent
werk subtask create "Write migration SQL" --task tk-a1b2c3 --agent
werk decision create "Use X over Y" --rationale "Why, tradeoffs" --agent
```
